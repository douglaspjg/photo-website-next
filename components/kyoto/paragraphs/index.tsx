                    This summer (2023), I traveled to Kyoto with the goal of
                    understanding more about how Modernism and Tradition exist
                    there today. Across hundreds of years, Kyoto City has
                    nurtured rich histories as one of Japan’s premodern
                    capitals. This includes the building of castles, devastating
                    fires, war, festivals, and much more. Today, these histories
                    are manifest in the various well preserved areas of the city
                    including the Gion, Ninenzaka/Sannenzaka, and Pontocho
                    areas. Yet, history is an ongoing process and this face of
                    Kyoto is not the only one that exists today; equally as
                    significant are the early modern and modern histories of
                    Kyoto. The changes that happened during this period can be
                    seen visually when comparing prewar Kyoto’s landscape to the
                    current day landscape. For example, when one arrives in
                    Kyoto, it is most likely in or around Kyoto Station, a
                    building known for its avant-garde steel and glass facade
                    that welcomes the modern age. Furthermore, in recent years,
                    the number of Kyo-machiya (characteristic traditional
                    Japanese style townhouses of Kyoto) has been decreasing
                    drastically, yet various groups are making efforts to
                    preserve them. Japanese people and foreigners alike are
                    investing in machiya, renovating and repurposing them to fit
                    the demands of the present day.

                    This got me curious about how the state of current day Kyoto
                    might fit in to a history that includes today, perhaps to
                    future historians or people with interest. What is Modern
                    and what is not? What is tradition and what is not? Are they
                    mutually exclusive, existing in two separate worlds?
                </p>
                <p className="kyoto-paragraph">
                    Throughout my experience, I put together collections of
                    photographs and divided them into two galleries: “Color” and
                    “Renovated Spaces”, each exploring the relationship between
                    Modernism and Tradition in Kyoto through a different lens.
                    When putting together the collections found in the “Color”
                    gallery, I thought about how color is used and regulated in
                    Kyoto, and what this might reveal about the existence of
                    Tradition and Modernism. My “Renovated Spaces” gallery is an
                    exploration of spaces that are associated with tradition in
                    Kyoto, particularly Machiya that have been recently
                    renovated and repurposed.
